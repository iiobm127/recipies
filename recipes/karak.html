        <p>I found this tea on a recent trip to the UAE but have learned that it is popular all over the Middle East. Roughly translated, karak chai means 'strong tea'. It differs from Masala chai by using fewer spices, slightly stronger tea, evaporated milk, and lump sugar. I make up a big batch in the morning and drink it throughout the day. It's nice chilled or reheated.</p>
